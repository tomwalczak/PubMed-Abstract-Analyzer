More than 10 million people worldwide are infected with the retrovirus human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). Infection phenotypes can range from asymptomatic to severe adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy. HTLV-1, like human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), is a blood-borne pathogen and viral infection happens in a similar fashion, with the major mode of transmission through breastfeeding. There is a strong correlation between time of infection and disease development, with a higher incidence of ATLL in patients infected during childhood. There is no successful therapeutic or preventative regimen for HTLV-1. It is therefore essential to develop therapies to inhibit transmission or block the onset/development of HTLV-1 associated diseases. Recently, we have seen the overwhelming success of integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) in the treatment of HIV-1. Previously, raltegravir was shown to inhibit HTLV-1 infection. Here, we tested FDA-approved and two Phase II HIV-1 INSTIs in vitro and in a cell-to-cell infection model and show that they are highly active in blocking HTLV-1 infection, with bictegravir (EC50 = 0.30 Â± 0.17 nM) performing best overall. INSTIs, in particular bictegravir, are more potent in blocking HTLV-1 transmission than tenofovir disproxil fumarate (TDF), an RT inhibitor. Our data suggest that HIV-1 INSTIs could present a good clinical strategy in HTLV-1 management and justifies the inclusion of INSTIs in clinical trials.

Effective treatments for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) fatigue are limited. We tested the effect of a pedometer-based intervention on increasing physical activity and decreasing fatigue among individuals with RA.
Participants completed baseline questionnaires; had 1 week of activity monitoring; were randomized to control (education [EDUC]), pedometer and step-monitoring diary (PED), or pedometer and diary plus step targets (PED+) groups, and were followed for 21 weeks. At week 10, questionnaires were administered by phone to all participants. During the final week, all participants again had 1 week of activity monitoring. Primary outcomes were changes in average weekly steps and fatigue (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 7-item questionnaire) from baseline to week 21. Secondary outcomes were self-reported disease activity, physical function, pain interference, and depressive symptoms. Changes in steps were tested using a linear mixed model. Changes in fatigue were tested with repeated-measures models, including baseline, week-10, and week-21 scores.
A total of 96 individuals participated. Eight did not complete the 21-week assessments. Both intervention groups significantly increased steps (+1,441 [P = 0.004] for PED and +1,656 [P = 0.001] for PED+), and the EDUC group decreased steps (-747 [P = 0.14]) (group-by-time interaction P = 0.0025). Between-group changes in fatigue were not significantly different (interaction P = 0.21). Mean changes in fatigue scores from baseline to week 21 were -1.6 (with-group P = 0.26), -3.2 (P = 0.02), and -4.8 (P = 0.0002) for EDUC, PED, and PED+ groups, respectively. Function and self-reported disease activity also improved in the PED and PED+ groups.
Provision of pedometers, with and without providing step targets, was successful in increasing activity levels and decreasing fatigue in this sample of individuals with RA.

Van der Waals assembly of two-dimensional crystals continue attract intense interest due to the prospect of designing novel materials with on-demand properties. One of the unique features of this technology is the possibility of trapping molecules between two-dimensional crystals. The trapped molecules are predicted to experience pressures as high as 1\u2009GPa. Here we report measurements of this interfacial pressure by capturing pressure-sensitive molecules and studying their structural and conformational changes. Pressures of 1.2\u00b10.3\u2009GPa are found using Raman spectrometry for molecular layers of 1-nm in thickness. We further show that this pressure can induce chemical reactions, and several trapped salts are found to react with water at room temperature, leading to two-dimensional crystals of the corresponding oxides. This pressure and its effect should be taken into account in studies of van der Waals heterostructures and can also be exploited to modify materials confined at the atomic interfaces.

Much progress has occurred over the past decade in rheumatoid arthritis trial design. Recognized challenges have led to the establishment of a clear regulatory pathway to demonstrate efficacy of a new therapeutic. The use of pure placebo beyond 12 to 16 weeks has been demonstrated to be unethical and thus background therapy and/or early rescue has become regular practice. Goals of remission and 'treating to targets' may prove more relevant to identify real-world use of new and existing therapeutics. Identification of rare adverse events associated with new therapies has resulted in intensive safety evaluation during randomized controlled trials and emphasis on postmarketing surveillance and use of registries.

Substantial progress has recently been made in optimizing the management of cancer patients, resulting in major gains in survival and quality of life. Much of this progress has resulted from the serial testing of promising treatment strategies, typically using prospective randomized controlled trials to compare outcomes achieved with the new approach versus the current standard(s) of care. However, there is an ever-expanding list of important questions that are difficult to investigate, particularly with respect to determining the optimal sequencing and combination of proven active agents. With the rapidly growing list of clinical, pathologic and molecular characteristics that promise to predict treatment benefit and/or risk for defined patient subsets, many new questions regarding how best to personalize our approach to treatment selection are emerging. These questions can be investigated in the context of registry-based randomized clinical trials. Recently, the potential of registry-based randomized clinical trials was demonstrated in cardiology, highlighting the ability to rapidly recruit large numbers of patients to a trial addressing an important clinical question, with minimal cost and high external validity. In this review, we discuss the challenges and limitations of conventional clinical trials in multidisciplinary cancer care, describe the potential advantages of registry-based randomized trials, and highlight several registry-based oncology studies that are already underway to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach.

Neutralization of tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-alpha) for three to six months reduces the symptoms and signs of rheumatoid arthritis. However, the capacity of this approach to effect a more sustained benefit and its effect on joint damage are not known.
We treated 428 patients who had active rheumatoid arthritis despite methotrexate therapy with placebo or infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against TNF-alpha, in intravenous doses of 3 or 10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 4 or 8 weeks in combination with oral methotrexate for 54 weeks. We assessed clinical responses with use of the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology, the quality of life with a health-status questionnaire, and the effect on joint damage radiographically.
The combination of infliximab and methotrexate was well tolerated and resulted in a sustained reduction in the symptoms and signs of rheumatoid arthritis that was significantly greater than the reduction associated with methotrexate therapy alone (clinical response, 51.8 percent vs. 17.0 percent; P<0.001). The quality of life was also significantly better with infliximab plus methotrexate than with methotrexate alone. Radiographic evidence of joint damage increased in the group given methotrexate, but not in the groups given infliximab and methotrexate (mean change in radiographic score, 7.0 vs. 0.6, P<0.001). Radiographic evidence of progression of joint damage was absent in infliximab-treated patients whether or not they had a clinical response.
In patients with persistently active rheumatoid arthritis despite methotrexate therapy, repeated doses of infliximab in combination with methotrexate provided clinical benefit and halted the progression of joint damage.

To evaluate the effectiveness of overall progressive resistance training in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
Randomized controlled clinical trial with blinded assessor and intention-to-treat analysis.
Sixty patients with rheumatoid arthritis according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria, aged between 18 and 65 years old, under stable medication and not performing regular physical activity were randomized into two groups: intervention group (IG) and control group (CG).
IG performed the progressive resistance strength training, twice a week, during 12 weeks. The training consists of exercising various muscle groups using a load of 50% and 70% of one repetition maximum. The load was reassessed and adjusted after six weeks of baseline. Both groups remained in conventional drug treatment during the study.
Patients were evaluated at baseline and after 6, 12, and 24 weeks, using HAQ and SF-36 questionnaires and strength.
Thirty-three patients in the CG and 27 in the IG were evaluated. The groups were homogeneous at baseline. Statistical and clinical improvement were found with better results for the IG in the HAQ questionnaire ( P=0.030), functional capacity (0=0.022) and pain ( P=0.027) domains of SF-36; and muscle strength for flexors of right and left knee ( P=0.005 and p=0.14), abductors of shoulder ( P=0.041) and extensors of right and left wrists ( P=0.003 and P= 0.005).
This progressive resistance strength training improves physical function as well as grip and muscular strength of knee flexors, shoulder abductors and wrist extensors in patients with RA, without adverse effects.

Intrathecal baclofen treatment is used for the treatment of dystonia in patients with severe dyskinetic cerebral palsy; however, the current level of evidence for the effect is low. The primary aim of this study was to provide evidence for the effect of intrathecal baclofen treatment on individual goals in patients with severe dyskinetic cerebral palsy.
This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed at 2 university medical centers in the Netherlands. Patients with severe dyskinetic cerebral palsy (Gross Motor Functioning Classification System level IV-V) aged 4 to 24 years who were eligible for intrathecal baclofen were included. Patients were assigned by block randomization (2:2) for treatment with intrathecal baclofen or placebo for 3 months via an implanted microinfusion pump. The primary outcome was goal attainment scaling of individual treatment goals (GAS T score). A linear regression model was used for statistical analysis with study site as a covariate. Safety analyses were done for number and type of (serious) adverse events.
Thirty-six patients were recruited from January 1, 2013, to March 31, 2018. Data for final analysis were available for 17 patients in the intrathecal baclofen group and 16 in the placebo group. Mean (standard deviation) GAS T score at 3 months was 38.9 (13.2) for intrathecal baclofen and 21.0 (4.6) for placebo (regression coefficient = 17.8, 95% confidence interval = 10.4-25.0, p < 0.001). Number and types of (serious) adverse events were similar between groups.
Intrathecal baclofen treatment is superior to placebo in achieving treatment goals in patients with severe dyskinetic cerebral palsy.

Nonpharmacologic interventions for symptom management in patients with rheumatoid arthritis are underinvestigated. Limited data suggest that aromatherapy massage and reflexology may help to reduce pain and fatigue in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The aim of this study was to examine and compare the effects of aromatherapy massage and reflexology on pain and fatigue in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The study sample was randomly assigned to either an aromatherapy massage (n = 17), reflexology (n = 17) or the control group (n = 17). Aromatherapy massage was applied to both knees of subjects in the first intervention group for 30 minutes. Reflexology was administered to both feet of subjects in the second intervention group for 40 minutes during weekly home visits. Control group subjects received no intervention. Fifty-one subjects with rheumatoid arthritis were recruited from a university hospital rheumatology clinic in Turkey between July 2014 and January 2015 for this randomized controlled trial. Data were collected by personal information form, DAS28 index, Visual Analog Scale and Fatigue Severity Scale. Pain and fatigue scores were measured at baseline and within an hour after each intervention for 6 weeks. Pain and fatigue scores significantly decreased in the aromatherapy massage and reflexology groups compared with the control group (p < .05). The reflexology intervention started to decrease mean pain and fatigue scores earlier than aromatherapy massage (week 1 vs week 2 for pain, week 1 vs week 4 for fatigue) (p < .05). Aromatherapy massage and reflexology are simple and effective nonpharmacologic nursing interventions that can be used to help manage pain and fatigue in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

To investigate the efficacy of a Mediterranean diet (MD) versus an ordinary Western diet for suppression of disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Patients with well controlled, although active RA of at least two years' duration, who were receiving stable pharmacological treatment, were invited to participate. All patients were randomly allocated to the MD or the control diet (CD). To achieve good compliance with prescribed diets all patients were for the first three weeks served the MD or the CD, respectively, for lunch and dinner at the outpatient clinic's canteen. Clinical examinations were performed at baseline, and again in the 3rd, 6th, and 12th week. A composite disease activity index (DAS28), a physical function index (Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)), a health survey of quality of life (Short Form-36 (SF-36)), and the daily consumption of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were used as primary efficacy variables.
 From baseline to the end of the study the patients in the MD group (n=26) showed a decrease in DAS28 of 0.56 (p<0.001), in HAQ of 0.15 (p=0.020), and in two dimensions of the SF-36 Health Survey: an increase in "vitality" of 11.3 (p=0.018) and a decrease in "compared with one year earlier" of 0.6 (p=0.016). For the control patients (n=25) no significant change was seen at the end of the study. This difference between the two treatment groups was notable only in the second half of the trial.
The results indicate that patients with RA, by adjusting to a Mediterranean diet, did obtain a reduction in inflammatory activity, an increase in physical function, and improved vitality.

G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) interact with the agonist-activated form of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to effect receptor phosphorylation and to initiate profound impairment of receptor signalling, or desensitization. GPCRs form the largest family of cell surface receptors known and defects in GRK function have the potential consequence to affect GPCR-stimulated biological responses in many pathological situations. This review focuses on the physiological role of GRKs revealed by genetically modified animals but also develops the involvement of GRKs in human diseases as, Oguchi disease, heart failure, hypertension or rhumatoid arthritis. Furthermore, the regulation of GRK levels in opiate addiction, cancers, psychiatric diseases, cystic fibrosis and cardiac diseases is discussed. Both transgenic mice and human pathologies have demonstrated the importance of GRKs in the signalling pathways of rhodopsin, beta-adrenergic and dopamine-1 receptors. The modulation of GRK activity in animal models of cardiac diseases can be effective to restore cardiac function in heart failure and opens a novel therapeutic strategy in diseases with GPCR dysregulation.
